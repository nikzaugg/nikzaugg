### Hey there, I am Nik

🇨🇭 I am a software engineer 👨🏼‍💻  from Zurich, Switzerland

🌐 I am interested in all things web.

🧑‍💼 From time to time, I do some work at [**zaeck**](https://zaeck.ch/en), where we are building [meine-traumhochzeit.ch](https://meine-traumhochzeit.ch/), a platform to search for and book wedding locations and services.

🗺️ Currently backpacking around the world. 
 
⛰️ Recently summitted Huayna Potosí in Bolivia (6'088m tall).

🌱 I believe going plant-based is the future.

📫 Hit me up if you want to know more. Looking for work starting in May 2023.
